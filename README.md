# Yet Another Scheme Compiler

This time use haskell.

## some good explainations I found

The IO type is an instance of the Monad class (a class of types). Monad is a concept. To say a value is of a type of the monad class is to say:

    there is (a certain type of) extra information attached to this value;
    most functions do not need to worry about these pieces of information.
